## Shaun Ho
A recent student of the Makers bootcamp, having changed career path after a decade of working within the world of quantum technologies. I have experience in multiple types of engineering. My work at Makers has allowed me to hone my skills in software which I plan on employing as a junior developer following the duration of the bootcamp

## Work Experience

**University of Strathclyde/TMD Technologies** (2018 to 2022)  
_Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) Associate/Development Engineer_

Technical lead for the R&D towards the creation of the gMOT - a miniaturised plug-and-play cold atom device. This work culminated in the development of a commercial tabletop device with integrated optical, vacuum, magnetic and electronic systems. This involved the use of python for the development of hardware control tools, and simulations and data analysis scripts for verification and validation activities. Furthermore, the device possessed an integrated PCB which was programmed in C++ using the Arduino framework.

## Skills

#### Knowledge Acquisition and Training
Able to acquire knowledge and disseminate the information effectively. My previous scientific posts have exposed me to many novel fields, technologies and bodies of work. Oftentimes there would be overwhelming amount of information, which required a filtering of all but the most salient parts to be incorporated into the product development or in order to train other employees.

#### Systems Thinking
A holistic understanding of the sub-systems involved in a product. In my prior role, I was involved in all parts of the development of a scientific instrument, combining the thought processes of disparate areas of engineering such as electrical and mechanical engineering. This wider scope of thinking allowed me to identify potential issues and failure modes within the product before they were manufactured.

#### Technical Knowledge
Possesses a broad knowledge of technical subjects. Throughout my scientific career, I have acquired the relevant skills and knowledge over a wide range of areas. Although my area of expertise is within the world quantum technologies, my previous projects have honed my abilities within electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, optical engineering, vacuum systems engineering, embedded systems and software engineering. I have consequently acquired the skills at using the tools within each of these realms. 

#### Project Management and Public Speaking
I have several years of project management. As the technical lead of the project in my previous role, I was responsible for acting as the interface between the academic and industrial partners, this involved translating the requirements of the academics into development and verification and validation tasks at the site of the industrial partners. This gave me the opportunity to mediate the needs of different groups through regular meetings where I was to chair and present the most recent work and developments allowing both parties to more effectively achieve a common goal.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June 2022 to September 2022)
A 12 weeks intensive course I took to consolidate my understanding of programming and familiarise myself with aspects of web development and software engineering. Including principles of test-driven development, model-view-controller architecture.
